# Microbit-Class-Evaluation-Monitor
Use a class set of Microbits to evaluate how a session went instead of using the usual paper forms.

One of the things that annoys me, and I'm sure classes don't appreciate, is the completion of paper evaluation forms. Why in this digital age would I want to use paper forms that I then have to go through? The forms that I have seen everyone use are all the same too. "On a scale of 1 to 5 how do you rate the experience? With 1 being low and 5 being high" 

So I thought there has to be a better, simpler way.

All you really need to know is a positive or negative response to a question. It's how the question is phrased that's important to get the correct kind of response. And if an evauation is quick it can also be utilised at the beginning and end of a short programme. Then a difference in responses can be gauged. Plus if the evaluation is fun the class will also enjoy particiption.

What if I could get the class to applaud if they appreciate something. It works for an audience so why not a class. A clapometer! Great, except I do not have a class set of the Microbit v2 which has the built in microphone. I do have a class set of the v1 though. If the class hold onto their Microbits whilst clapping then the Microbit would record a 'shake'. All I'd need to do is record how many were shaking.

The result here are two files: 

-One for the participants in the class. If they wish to answer in an affirmative way they hold the Microbits and either clap or shake their hands. Otherwise they hold the Microbit face down on the desk.

-The other file is for the questioner. After asking each question wait for all the class to respond then press the A button. The number of appaulds is recorded. Once all the questions have been asked press the B button to see the values for each response. Note them down on your record. All done. No paper, no fuss, no time wasting going through all the responses trying to read the hand writing. And no boring evaluation forms for the class to complete either.

Put file transmitter on to the Microbits for the class. The other receiver on a single one for you. Power them all up with battery packs and hand them out to the class.
